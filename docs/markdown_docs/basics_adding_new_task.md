# Adding a New Task

There are two ways to add a new tasks to the system. First we describe the standard case where a task name is directly mapped to a class name. In the second part we describe how to map a task to a more generic class.

## Code requirements

In order to start adding a new task to tactus, a *file* containing your task needs to be created in the `$TACTUS_HOME/tactus/tasks` folder, where **$TACTUS_HOME** points to the full name to the folder in which tactus is installed.

In the `tasks` folder, the `discover_task.py` file looks for the task specified in the ```tactus run``` command. The task name should be the name of the **class** of your task, as it's in the class names that discover_task.py gets the tasks available. For ease of use, the *file* name containing your class can also be named the same as the class.

A created task **class** usually inherits the **Task** class from the `base.py` file inside the `tasks` folder The new tasks inherit the **Task** class, one can define their own `execute` , `prep` , `post`  and `run` functions and possibly define new ones.

Inside that `[task.taskname]` directive, the *wrapper* and *command* settings could be set to their appropriate values if they are used by the task. The *wrapper* setting sets a wrapper for the command needed to be run, most commonly commands `time` or `srun`. The *wrapper* setting comes from the **BatchJob** class included from `batch.py` inside `base.py`.

```
wrapper = self.get_task_setting("wrapper")
self.batch = BatchJob(os.environ, wrapper)

cmd = self.get_task_setting("command")
self.batch.run(cmd)
```
The `run` function of the **BatchJob** class unites these two settings before running them as one in our task.
```
cmd = self.wrapper + " " + cmd
```

## Handling output

In order to copy files, inside the `task.py` file, the `fmanager` directive from the `tactus/toolbox.py` file needs to be used. To create the input for the task, the `fmanager.input` function needs to be called.
```
def input(
    self,
    target,
    destination,
    basetime=None,
    validtime=None, # noqa
    check_archive=False,
    provider_id="symlink",
)
```
The `fmanager.input` only has two non-optional arguments and providers for *symlink, copy*, *move* and *ECFS*.
The paths used with `fmanager` should be put into macros and not hardcoded.
To link for example MASTERODB, one needs to call the function the following way:
`self.fmanager.input("@BINDIR@/MASTERODB", "MASTERODB")`
To copy or move, one only needs to add a provider_id:
`self.fmanager.input("@BINDIR@/MASTERODB", "MASTERODB", provider_id="copy")`

To handle output data, the `fmanager.output` function needs to be called after the running of the code in a similar way as the input. Example:
`self.fmanager.output("ICMSH@CNMEXP@+000?", "@OUTDIR@/ICMSH@CNMEXP@+000?")`. The same providers are available for output as for input.

## Submission rules for a task

In order to setup submission options, they need to be added to the `config.toml` file needs. One can either add to an already existing submit type, like the default `serial`, or create their own submission type. To add SLURM options, a name of the option along with the option itself needs to be added inside the `submission.submissiontype.BATCH` directive:
```
[submission.parallel.BATCH]
WALLTIME = "#SBATCH --time=00:11:00"
QOS = "#SBATCH --qos=np"
NTASKS = "#SBATCH --ntasks=128"
CORES = "#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4"
MULTITHREAD = "#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread"
NODES = "#SBATCH -N 4"
NAME = "#SBATCH --job-name=fcast_task"

```

To add environment variables, set them in the `submission.submissiontype.ENV` directive, and they will be exported in the job file
```
[submission.parallel.ENV]
DR_HOOK = "1"
OMP_NUM_THREADS = "2"
```

Modules are loaded with a spefic category in `submission.submissiontype.MODULES`:

```
[submission.parallel.MODULES]
ECFLOW = ["load","ecflow"]
```
which will perform a `module load` of `ecflow`. other module options are also possible.

Environment files can also be sourced with the `submission.submissiontype.ENV_FILE` section:

```
[submission.parallel.ENV_FILE]
env_file_path = "/path/to/your/env/file"
```


One can also specify these in a task.exceptions directive:
```
[submission.task_exceptions.Newtask.BATCH]
WALLTIME = "#SBATCH --time=00:11:00"
QOS = "#SBATCH --qos=np"
NTASKS = "#SBATCH --ntasks=128"
CORES = "#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4"
MULTITHREAD = "#SBATCH --hint=nomultithread"
NODES = "#SBATCH -N 4"
NAME = "#SBATCH --job-name=fcast_task"

[submission.task_exceptions.Newtask.ENV]
MODULE = "print('My beautiful module')"
OS = "import os"
```


After that is all done, the new task can be ran with:
```
tactus --config-file=/your/config.toml run --task yourtask  --template $PWD/tactus/templates/stand_alone.py  --job $PWD/yourtask.job  --troika-config $PWD/config.yml  -o $PWD/yourtask.log
```

If `config_file` is specified under `[troika]` in config.yml, one can skip the `--troika-config` argument.

## Map a task name to a generic class
A class can be resued for several tasks with different names. This can be useful when we want to contstruct very similar tasks with minor differences. One example could be processing of different observation types. Another example is the cleaning task which we will use as an example in the following.

To run the task in stand alone mode we define the class mapping and extra arguments as
```
[general]
  tactus_task = "Cleaning"
[task.args]
  cleaning_type = "CycleCleaning"
```
where `tactus_task` defines the class we map to, `Cleaning` in this case. In `ARGS` we defined the class specific arguments that defines the behaviour for this task. In the corresponding class `Cleaning` we pick up this setting using

```
cleaning_type = config["task.args.cleaning_type"]
```

The same rules applies for controlling the submission of tasks as in the standard case.

When constructing the task in e.g. Ecflow we define the EcflowSuiteTask as

```
EcflowSuiteTask(
  "CycleCleaning",
  ...
  variables={ "TACTUS_TASK": "Cleaning",
              "ARGS": "cleaning_type=CycleCleaning",
            },
  ...
)
```
Note that here `TACTUS_TASK` has to be in upper case as it's communicated as an environment variable.
